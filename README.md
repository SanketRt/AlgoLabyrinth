# AlgoViz: Algorithm Visualization Toolkit

**AlgoViz** is a Python project that provides interactive, real-time visualizations for core algorithms in computer science, currently featuring:

1. **Maze Solver Visualizer**: Generates random perfect mazes and solves them side by side with four classic graph-search algorithms.
2. **Convex Hull Visualizer**: Builds and animates the convex hull of a random 2D point cloud using Jarvis‚Äôs March and Graham Scan.

## üîç Features

| Visualizer              | Algorithms                                     | Layout                  |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Maze Solver**         | BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, A*                         | 2√ó2 quadrant view       |
| **Convex Hull**         | Jarvis‚Äôs March (Gift Wrapping), Graham Scan    | 1√ó2 side-by-side panes  |

- **Real-time Animation**: Watch algorithm steps‚Äîvisits, comparisons, and constructive operations‚Äîin action.
- **Frame Control**: Auto-play, manual stepping (‚Üê/‚Üí), and reset (press **R**).
- **GIF Export**: Automatic capture and saving of convex hull runs as `convex_hull_animation.gif`.
- **Benchmarking (Maze)**: Collect timing, node counts, and path lengths with Matplotlib plots.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SanketRt/AlgoViz.git
cd AlgoViz
```

2. **Create & activate a virtual environment**:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate    # Windows: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### üèÉ Maze Solver Visualizer

Launch the maze solver animation:

```bash
python3 visualize.py
```

You‚Äôll see a window divided into four quadrants showing BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, and A* exploring and solving the same random maze.

### üèñ Convex Hull Visualizer

Animate convex hull construction:

```bash
python3 visualize_ch.py
```

- Left pane: **Jarvis‚Äôs March**
- Right pane: **Graham Scan**
- Auto-advances until both hulls complete, displays elapsed time, and saves `convex_hull_animation.gif` upon exit.
